## Synchronization mechanisms

The threads library provides three synchronization mechanisms:

- **mutexes** = Mutual exclusion lock: Block access to variables by other threads. This enforces exclusive access by a thread to a variable or set of variables.
- **joins** = Make a thread wait till others are complete (terminated).
- **condition variables** = While mutexes implement synchronization by controlling thread access to data, condition variables allow threads to synchronize based upon the actual value of data.

We already know about joins, so weâ€™ll focus on mutexes now...
