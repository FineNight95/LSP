## Managing thread exit with C

```
#include<pthread.h>
void pthread_cleanup_push(void (*routine)(void *), void *arg);
void pthread_cleanup_pop(int execute);
```

- The **pthread_cleanup_push()** function pushes routine onto the top of the stack of clean-up handlers. When routine is later invoked, it will be given arg as its argument.

- The **pthread_cleanup_pop()** function removes the routine at  the  top  of the  stack  of clean-up handlers, and optionally executes it if execute is nonzero.
