## Mutexes

**Mutexes** are used to prevent data inconsistencies due to operations by multiple threads upon the same memory area performed at the same time or to prevent **race conditions** where an order of operation upon the memory is expected.

A contention or **race condition** often occurs when two or more threads need to perform operations on the same memory area, but the results of computations depends on the order in which these operations are performed. 

Mutexes are used for serializing shared resources such as memory. Anytime a global resource is accessed by more than one thread the resource should have a Mutex associated with it.
