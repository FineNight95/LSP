## Problems with threads - mutex deadlock

**Mutex Deadlock**: This condition occurs when a mutex is applied but then not "unlocked". 

This causes program execution to halt indefinitely. It can also be caused by poor **application** of mutexes or **joins**. 

Be careful when applying two or more mutexes to a section of code. If the first **pthread_mutex_lock** is applied and the second **pthread_mutex_lock** fails due to another thread applying a mutex, the first mutex may eventually lock all other threads from accessing data including the thread which holds the second mutex.

The threads may wait indefinitely for the resource to become free causing a deadlock. It is best to test and if failure occurs, free the resources and stall before retrying.
