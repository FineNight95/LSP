## Exercise

### Project AdvancedChat:

Modify the network server/client pair of programs from the previous lecture with the following changes:

- The server should support additional optional argument '**-p**', which if present, identifies that the communication is in '**polite mode**'. In this mode, the server should accept the clientsâ€™ messages in rounds - when a client sends a message the next message from the same client will not be processed until all other connected clients send their messages. You may change the communication protocol between clients and server if you need to.

- The server should store the chat history into a file '**chat.log**'.
