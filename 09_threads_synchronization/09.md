## Problems with threads - race conditions

**Race conditions**: While the code may appear on the screen in the order you wish the code to execute, threads are scheduled by the operating system and are executed at random. It cannot be assumed that threads are executed in the order they are created. 

They may also execute at different speeds. When threads are executing (racing to complete) they may give unexpected results (race condition). 

**Mutexes** and **joins** must be utilized to achieve a predictable execution order and outcome.
