## Exiting the Threads

A thread can arrange for functions to be called when it exits. These functions are known as **thread cleanup handlers**. More than one cleanup handler can be established for a thread. The handlers are recorded in a **stack**, which means that they are executed in the reverse order from that with which they were registered.

When  a thread is canceled or terminates by calling **pthread_exit()**, all of the stacked clean-up handlers are popped and executed in the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack.
