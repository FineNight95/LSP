## Problems with threads - thread safe code

**Thread safe code**: The threaded routines must call functions which are "thread safe". 

This means that there are no static or global variables which other threads may clobber or read assuming single threaded operation. If static or global variables are used then mutexes must be applied or the functions must be re-written to avoid the use of these variables. 

In C, local variables are dynamically allocated on the stack. Therefore, any function that does not use static data or other shared resources is thread-safe. 

Thread-unsafe functions may be used by only one thread at a time in a program and the uniqueness of the thread must be ensured.
