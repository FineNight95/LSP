## Creating and destroying mutexes

```
#include<pthread.h>
void pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, const pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);
void pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t *mutex
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
```

Mutex variables must be declared with type **pthread_mutex_t**, and must be initialized before they can be used. There are two ways to initialize a mutex variable:

- Statically, when it is declared. 
- Dynamically, with the **pthread_mutex_init()** routine. This method permits setting mutex object attributes, attr. **The mutex is initially unlocked**.
