## Locking and unlocking mutexes

```
#include<pthread.h>
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_mutex_trylock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
```

- **pthread_mutex_lock()** = used by a thread to acquire a lock on the specified mutex variable. If the mutex is already locked by another thread, this call will block the calling thread until the mutex is unlocked.

- **pthread_mutex_trylock()** = will attempt to lock a mutex. However, if the mutex is already locked, the routine will return immediately with a "busy" error code. This routine may be useful in preventing deadlock conditions, as in a priority-inversion situation.

- **pthread_mutex_unlock()** = will unlock a mutex if called by the owning thread. Calling this routine is required after a thread has completed its use of protected data if other threads are to acquire the mutex for their work with the protected data.
