## Typical use of mutexes

A typical sequence in the use of a mutex is as follows:

- Create and initialize a mutex variable
- Several threads attempt to lock the mutex
- Only one succeeds and that thread owns the mutex
- The owner thread performs some set of actions
- The owner unlocks the mutex
- Another thread acquires the mutex and repeats the process
- Finally the mutex is destroyed

When several threads compete for a mutex, the losers block at that call - an unblocking call is available with **trylock()** instead of the lock call.

When protecting shared data every thread that needs to use a mutex should do so. For example, if 4 threads are updating the same data, but only one uses a mutex, the data can still be corrupted.
