## libpthreads (POSIX threads)

**pthreads** defines a set of C programming language types, functions and constants that support applications with requirements for multiple flows of control, called threads, within a process. It is implemented with a pthread.h header and a pthread library.

There are around 100 threads procedures, all prefixed pthread_ and they can be categorized into four groups:

- Thread management - creating, joining threads etc.
- Mutexes
- Condition variables
- Synchronization between threads using read/write locks and barriers

Weâ€™re only going to cover "Thread management" in this part.
