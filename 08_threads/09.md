## Thread management functions â€“ types

The **pthread_cancel()** function sends a cancellation request to a thread.

Whether and when the target thread reacts to the cancellation request depends on two attributes that are under the control of that thread: its cancelability state (enabled/disabled) and type:

- **Deferred** (default behaviour) cancelability means that cancellation will be delayed until the thread next calls a function that is a cancellation point (**pthread_testcancel()** and others).

- **Asynchronous** cancelability means that the thread can be canceled at any time (usually immediately, but the system does not guarantee this).
