## Creating threads

Initially, your **main()** program comprises a single, default thread. All other threads must be explicitly created by the programmer.  pthread_create creates a new thread and makes it executable. This routine can be called any number of times from anywhere within your code.

**pthread_create** arguments:

- **thread**: An opaque, unique identifier for the new thread returned by the subroutine.
- **attr**: An opaque attribute object that may be used to set thread attributes. You can specify a thread attributes object, or NULL for the default values.
- **start_routine**: the C routine that the thread will execute once it is created.
- **arg**: A single argument that may be passed to start_routine. It must be passed by reference as a pointer cast of type void. NULL may be used if no argument is to be passed.
