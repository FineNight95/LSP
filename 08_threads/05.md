## Finishing threads

### Terminating Threads & pthread_exit()

There are several ways in which a thread may be terminated:

- The thread returns normally from its starting routine. Its work is done.
- The thread makes a call to the **pthread_exit** subroutine - whether its work is done or not.
- The thread is canceled by another thread via the **pthread_cancel** routine.
- The entire process is terminated due to making a call to either the **exec()** or **exit()**
- If main() finishes first, without calling **pthread_exit** explicitly itself
